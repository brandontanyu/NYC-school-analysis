# Fairness In Scholastic Aptitute Test In New York City For College Admission

This project aims at verifying the  demographic factors influencing  score at the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) in New York City.


* New York City makes all high school SAT test data [availabel here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)


* Demographic data for each school can be gotten [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2)

Unfortunately, combining both of the datasets won't give us all of the demographic information we want to use. We'll need to supplement our data with other sources to do our full analysis.

The same website has several related datasets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the datasets we'll be using:
